**Project Proposal**

Overview
In this project, we delve into the economic impacts of air travel disruptions, focusing on the US commercial aviation industry. With an estimated global economic impact of $67.5 billion, as reported by AirHelp in 2023, half of which affects the US, it's crucial to analyze flight delays and cancellations. Our goal is to enhance air travel efficiency and passenger satisfaction by understanding the trends, challenges, and opportunities in the aviation sector.

**Objectives**

Our analysis will cover:

Identification of the most and least reliable airlines in terms of on-time departures.
Analysis of flight delays/cancellations over time, including variations by month, day, and hour.
Identification of airports and routes with the highest average delays.
Investigation of common reasons for delays/cancellations and their trends over time.
Focus Area
The initial phase will involve a comprehensive analysis of the civil aviation industry from a national perspective, eventually zooming into a specific focus on Boston.

**Data Source**

We will be utilizing the "U.S. Department Of Transportation Air Travel Consumer Report - Airline Flight Delays in 2015" dataset, primarily sourced from Kaggle. This dataset includes over 5.8 million commercial airline flights in 2015, encompassing detailed information such as airline name, flight number, origin/destination airports, flight distance, and scheduled/actual departure and arrival times.
